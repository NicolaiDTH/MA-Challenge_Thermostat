Instructions:
--
For interface - Run the index.html from your directory in a browser.
For Jasmine Tests - Run the Specrunner file in the browser.

Lessons Learned:
--
* More JavaScript!
* Building tests to construct the client's provided requirements.
* Drying JQuery code.
* Adding and removing classes via script lines.

Problems With The Code:
--
* Basic interface.
* JQuery tested via trial and error via browser.
